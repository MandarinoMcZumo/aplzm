# Apl√°zame technical test
____
### Requirements

In order to run the application:
- Docker  
- Docker compose

To execute tests:
- python 3.9.10  
- all the required libraries across the different requirements.txt files

The first execution the server must be initialized. In order to create the required database:
1. Connect to the DB container through the port 3306 or straight from the Docker command line
2. Execute the following commands:  
   `mariadb -uroot -p${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}`  
   `create database if not exists apzm;`

____
### Run

#### Tests
From the project directory  
`python3 -m base/tests/test.py`  
`python3 -m predict/tests/test.py`  
`python3 -m registry/tests/test.py`
#### Service
From the project directory  
`docker-compose up`

        }
    ]
}

### Design overview
The service is built from 4 different Docker Images:
- [Maria DB](db) database
- 3 Flask Services:
  - [Base API](base) - Used as an interface that checks, validates and routes the requests
  - [Predict API](predict) - Applies the model to the already validated parameters 
  - [Registry API](registry) - Connects to the Database to update/retrieve records

All the services and configuration can be found in [the docker-compose file.](docker-compose.yaml)
